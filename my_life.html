        <h2>Early Life</h2>

        <p>I grew up in a small sleepy town located in North Georgia called Dalton. Known for it's carpet and not much more than that, Dalton was and is an uneventful place. With a population of not much more than 30,000, Dalton manages to still have 3 Waffle Houses. I love Waffle House as much as the next guy (probably more honestly), but I think this better illustrates the small southern town I grew up in. </p>
